    "Despite games being the most common genre of app in the App store, navigation, reference and Social Networking top the list in average number of reviews.  Now we do not have a column for number of downloads so number of reviews is the closest we can get to see how popular genres of apps are.  Now our goal is to create an app profile that generates revenue from in app ads.  Ads in a navigation app are more likely to be ignored as people are usually in transit while using them and do not have a time to check out different products.  Social networking and reference apps are next most polular in terms of number of reviews, but just because there are a lot of reviews does not mean that they are good.  Let's now look at the highest rated genres."

Looking at the highest number of reviews and the highest ratings speaks to a new social media platform specifically geared towards shopping and business.  Let's look at the google play store installs for each genre and see if this idea would play well in the paly store as well!"

What we are proposing for an app profile is a social media app that businesses partner with to provide users with discounts.  This app will encourage users to travel the city to get steps and find landmarks.  This app will track location and send the users ads with mystery businesses that will require the user to open to see.  In these ads will be small discounts to local stores that can only be unlocked by reaching a certain number of steps or travelling to a certain landmark nearby and taking a picture to upload to the app. Following businesses and uploading pics of users in front of those businesses will also unlock discounts for the user."
